                        Steven Paul Jobs or 'Steve Jobs' as he was better known was an American entrepeneur and a forefather to the modern technological and media indsutries. He was a prolific leader and investor with influence in the boardroom within Pixar as well as The Walt Disney Company when they eventually acquisitioned the former. However he was most notably known as the chairman, CEO and co-founder of 'Apple Inc.'. Alongside his partner Steve Wozniak Steve pioneered the 'personal computer revolution' of the 80's and 90's bringing to our doorstep the portable computer or 'PC' that we know and love today.

                    <p>
                        Together the duo found their way into fame and fortune; building off of their success with Wozniak's 'Apple I' personal computer, when they released the incredibly ground breaking second generation. One of the first mass-produced microcomputers to achieve financial success. However this was only to be the first of many successes to come; with Jobs highlighting areas of potential within the tech sphere and working alongside his partner to harness the latent ability within them. Creating products with a focus on harnessing functionaly through intelligent design Apple grew into the tech powerhouse it is today. The same principles can be seen today in 'glassmorphism' in the UI space; a simple, minimalistic design that leads beautifully into the modern aesthetic we assosciate with new technology.
